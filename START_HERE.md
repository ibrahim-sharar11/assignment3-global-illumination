4. Don't check any boxes!
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Copy the URL GitHub shows you
7. Run this in Terminal:

### 💾 I just want to copy it somewhere (no GitHub)

**Super simple:**
1. Right-click the `Example12` folder
2. Click "Compress Example12" (makes a zip file)
3. Copy the zip to USB, email, or cloud storage
4. On other device: Extract it → Done!

The `.git` folder is inside, so it's still a full repository on the other device!
